# IBESTAT
This repository contains, as faithfully as possible, the application carried out at IBESTAT of the SUT-RAS model on the input-output tables of the Balearic Islands. All of the project was carried out during my internship as part of the Master's Degree in Big Data Analysis at the University of the Balearic Islands.

## Contextualization
Given the complexity involved in conducting and processing surveys to obtain origin and destination tables —which constitute the foundation of input-output tables— statistical institutes are increasingly resorting to projection models to extend base year data into time series.

In this project from IBESTAT, the base year 2014 is used as the starting point for projecting the 2015–2018 series using the most widely accepted method in the current scientific literature: SUT-RAS. However, before delving into the methodology, it is necessary to recall some essential concepts. The Destination tables, also known as Use tables, represent, for each industry, the distribution of consumption across all types of goods and services. Thus, each cell shows the monetary value of the product/service (row) consumed by each industry (column). This structure allows analysis of both the inputs required by each industry and the total demand for a given product.

Similarly, the Origin tables (also Supply tables) represent, for each industry, the monetary value of the production of goods and services. Each cell reflects the amount of output of a given product or service generated by a particular industry. These two matrices form the backbone of the Supply and Use Tables (SUT), which are subsequently transformed into Input-Output Tables (IOT) to analyze the interdependencies between industries and products.

## Introduction to the model
The SUT-RAS model is an iterative projection method widely used in official statistics to extend Supply and Use Tables to non-survey years. Its logic is based on preserving the structural relationships observed in a base year (2014 in this project), while adjusting the tables to match new totals of production, imports, value added and final demand observed in subsequent years. Through successive iterations, the model proportionally redistributes the values in rows and columns until the supply and use sides of the economy converge consistently.

For the SUT-RAS model to be valid, the iterative adjustments must reach a convergence condition. This occurs when, after successive redistributions of rows and columns, the projected supply and use tables reproduce the target totals (production, imports, gross value added and final demand) within an acceptable margin of error. In practice, convergence is achieved when the difference between supply and demand —both by products and by industries— falls below a pre-defined tolerance level, ensuring that the matrices are consistent and balanced.

## Overview of the internship
The entire development of the IBESTAT application was carried out by me, from the initial design to the delivery of the final results, within a constrained timeframe of three months. The work began with a systematic validation of the existing literature, complemented by internal tests that confirmed SUT-RAS as the most suitable model. As part of this validation, the SUT-EURO model was implemented in MATLAB using data from the Instituto Cántabro de Estadística (ICANE), followed by the creation of a complete adaptation of SUT-EURO in R, applied sequentially to a fictitious basic example, to the Supply and Use Tables of the INE, and subsequently to those of IBESTAT. In parallel, the GRAS model was programmed from scratch in R and applied under the same staged approach (fictitious example → INE → IBESTAT). Additionally, a variant of the SUT-RAS model was developed in R and tested in these three contexts. Finally, a SUT-RAS variant provided by the INE in SAS was adapted and applied to the IBESTAT data to obtain the definitive projections. The project constituted an exhaustive methodological exercise, requiring the implementation, adaptation, and comparative evaluation of multiple models in different programming environments.

## Structure
The structure of this repository consists of: a directory for each model or model variant that has been worked on; a folder containing most of the scientific bibliography used; a data folder; and a folder where the results extracted from the basic example and the INE can be consulted (IBESTAT has not yet published the results). Additionally, you can find the technical README.md file, which I created for the IBESTAT local repository. As well as the final report on the project's development, issues encountered, and evaluation of results.
